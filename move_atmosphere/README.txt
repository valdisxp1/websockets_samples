This is the atmosphere framework example.
I used the oficial "chat" sample and DIDN'T change the server side.

How to use:
Download(clone) the atmosphere samples (https://github.com/Atmosphere/atmosphere)
do a maven package on /samples/chat/ to make sure it builds
add the attached files in /samples/chat/src/main/webapp/ accourding the existing file structure.
do another mvn package and use the .war file on your java servelet engine(like tomcat-7)
